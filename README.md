# 🚀 Multipage Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project is the final assignment for the PLP Web Technologies module. It demonstrates my ability to plan, build, organize, and deploy a responsive, interactive multi-page website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The site serves as a personal portfolio to showcase my skills, services, and contact information.

## 🧭 Site Structure
The website includes the following pages:
- **Home** – Introduction and welcome message
- **About** – Personal background and mission
- **Services** – Overview of offerings and expertise
- **Contact** – Form for inquiries and contact details

Each page shares a consistent layout with a responsive header, footer, and navigation menu.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
